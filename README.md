# Unit-Converter
This is a personal project that I have been working on for a while. It is programmed using Java. It has several packages that contain the category of the unit to be converted. The app interface is also provided but the classes are used to be individually used. The app itself has options for categories and then to converted to the selected unit to the other units.
